# 1. Data Collection
# Collect the data from provided documents (e.g., .docx files) to extract email content for further processing.
from docx import Document

# Function to extract text from docx files
def extract_text_from_docx(docx_file):
    doc = Document(docx_file)
    full_text = []
    for para in doc.paragraphs:
        full_text.append(para.text)
    return '\n'.join(full_text)

# Example usage
file_path = 'path_to_your_docx_file'
text = extract_text_from_docx(file_path)
print(text)


Explanation steps:
- This section focuses on collecting data from .docx files.
- The "extract_text_from_docx" function reads a .docx file and extracts the text from each paragraph.
- The extracted text is then joined into a single string with newline characters separating the paragraphs.
- The example usage demonstrates how to use this function to extract text from a specified .docx file.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

# python
## **2. Data Preprocessing
# Clean the email text by removing unnecessary information, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis.
import re

# Preprocess the extracted text
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
    text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)  # Remove numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()  # Remove extra whitespace
    return text

# Example usage
cleaned_text = preprocess_text(text)
print(cleaned_text)


# Explanation:
- This section is dedicated to cleaning the extracted text data.
- The `preprocess_text` function performs several preprocessing steps:
  - Converts the text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
  - Removes numbers using regular expressions.
  - Removes extra whitespace and trims the text.
- The example usage shows how to apply this function to the extracted text.

# 3. Data Annotation

# python
# 3. Data Annotation
# Label the preprocessed emails with metadata such as structure, tone, and purpose for training the NLP model.
# Example of adding a manual label (e.g., tone, purpose)
emails = [{'email': cleaned_text, 'category': 'Meeting Request', 'tone': 'Formal'}]

# Display the annotated email
print(emails)

# Explanation Notes:
- This section involves annotating the preprocessed emails with metadata.
- The example demonstrates how to manually label an email with categories such as 'Meeting Request' and tone such as 'Formal'.
- This metadata will be useful for training the NLP model to understand the context and purpose of the emails.

# Display top TF-IDF words
feature_names = tfidf.get_feature_names_out()
print("Top 10 TF-IDF words:", feature_names[:10])

# Email Category Distribution
# Assuming the dataset has a 'category' column
category_counts = emails_df['category'].value_counts()

# Plot category distribution

plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Count')

    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]

# This section involves exploring the annotated data to uncover patterns and insights:
- Basic Descriptive Statistics: Calculates and displays the number of words and characters per email.
- Sentiment Analysis: Uses "TextBlob" to analyze the sentiment and subjectivity of the email content.
- Bigram and Trigram Analysis: Generates and displays the most common bigrams (pairs of words) in the email content.
- Word Cloud for Visualization: Creates and displays a word cloud to visualize the most common words in the email content.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Uses "spaCy" to extract named entities from the email content.
- Keyword/Topic Extraction: Computes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to identify the most important words in the email content.
- Email Category Distribution: Plots the distribution of email categories.
- Tokenize and Remove Stopwords: Tokenizes the email content and removes stopwords, then plots the most common words.
